					<!-- Content -->
					<h2 id="content">My name is Luan Leone de Jesus</h2>
					<p>I am a Data Analyst with a degree in Computer Engineering and over six years of experience
						managing, developing,
						and improving transactional communication journeys as a CCM Systems Analyst. Additionally, I
						develop data products
						using machine learning techniques to solve business issues.</p>

					<p>My primary objective is to work as a Data Scientist, developing data products with machine
						learning techniques and statistical analysis to help companies make strategic decisions in the
						best possible way.</p>

					<p>At SulAmerica, my functions included managing and customizing communication stages with the
						company's customers.
						I developed and analyzed routines for physical documents (such as sending to the post office)
						and digital communications,
						including email, SMS, WhatsApp, and queries via APIs. Additionally, I helped client areas make
						strategic decisions through
						data extraction and analysis.</p>
					<p>At Sinqia and Senior Solution, I worked as a Systems Analyst providing support services to CRM
						systems and institutional
						portals for partner companies. My primary activities were ensuring that the systems were working
						correctly and generating
						health metrics for each one through controls of open incidents in monitoring systems like Jira.
					</p>
					<p>As a professional, I am committed to improving some points that I believe are essential for the
						future of my career.
						One of them is enhancing my knowledge and skills in data science through training with Community
						DS (Brazilian School
						of High-Level Data Scientist Training) and IA Expert Academy.</p>

						<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
					</header>

					<h2 id="content">6+ Years as Systems Analyst (Insurance Industry)</h2>
					<p>Responsible for creating transactional communication journeys across multiple channels (sending
						letters through the Post Office, digital dispatches like email, SMS, WhatsApp, generating
						on-demand documents via API, among others), generating value for the company and improving the
						customer experience. Additionally, I manage and monitor communications to solve possible
						problems in the journey and analyze the communicated data to generate insights for our
						stakeholders, facilitating strategic decision-making for the company.</p>

					<h2 id="content">3+ Completed Data Science Projects</h2>
					<p>Developed data solutions for business problems, close to real challenges faced by companies,
						using public data from Data Science competitions. I addressed the problem from the conception of
						the business challenge to the publication of the trained algorithm in production, using Cloud
						Computing tools.</p>

					<h2 id="content">1+ Year as Systems Support Intern</h2>
					<p>During the internship, in addition to technical skills such as database manipulation, web page
						development, and others, I improved my soft skills, such as communication, which facilitated the
						process of extracting information from clients. Improving the understanding of the problems so
						that I could plan and organize the strategies that would be applied to deliver and/or solve the
						points requested by the client.</p>

							<h3>Star Jeans - A Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis Project</h3>
							<p>This project involves a fictional Brazilian company that intends to enter the American
								fashion market by establishing an e-commerce store for selling men's jeans. The
								objective is to keep operating costs low and scale up as they acquire more customers.
								<br><br>
								In addition to defining the target audience and product, the company aims to gain
								insights into the American market for this segment in order to set competitive prices
								for its products. The company considers its main competitor to be H&M, a large-scale
								American fashion company. As such, the Brazilian company hires a data science consulting
								firm to answer some business problem questions.

							<h3>Rossmann Drug Stores - Sales Prediction</h3>
							<p>This is a forecasting data science project inspired by the Rossmann Store Sales
								competition on Kaggle. The scenario involves predicting the sales for each of the
								company's stores for the next six weeks in order to facilitate decision-making, such as
								whether or not to build a new store in a few weeks.</p>

							<h3>HealthGuard Insurance: Cross-Sell Prediction (In progress)</h3>
							<p>This project uses data from a health insurance company that conducted a survey to assess
								customer interest in a potential car insurance policy. The objective is to analyze and
								study the data in order to classify and rank customers according to their interest, so
								that those with the highest likelihood of purchasing the policy can be prioritized and
								placed at the top of the ranking. This will optimize the contact process for the sales
								team and assist in making more accurate decisions. As a result, a performance was
								achieved that would result in almost three times the accuracy compared to using a random
								method to select customers, according to the business model described in the problem
								definition. The model's results can be accessed through a Google Sheets spreadsheet.</p>
